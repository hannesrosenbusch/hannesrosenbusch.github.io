My interests are behavioral data science and the psychology of humor.

Currently, I work as a data scientist at Appinio and as an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam (department of psychological methods).

My PhD work focused on developing software and statistical techniques for behavioral scientists. More recently, I started doing research on what makes things funny.

So if you have an idea for a cool, interdisciplinary project...

**Let me know!**

Outside of the office, I like watching stand-up, playing soccer, and walking my parents' 14-year old dog Dobby, who is a Golden Retriever that is balding on the nose and has lost some of his early-life agility, but who, nonetheless, brings joy to anyone who visits my parents, and who is going to live forever.
