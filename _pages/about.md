I am a PhD student at Tilburg University, who is interested in applying computer science methods to psychological research.

During my master studies, I decide to integrate my hobby (computer science) with my research (psychological science).

New methods to acquire, process, and analyze data are always fascinating to me and I have a lot of fun applying them to social science questions.

I currently work at a social psychology department, but I regularly collaborate with researchers from other disciplines.

So if you have an idea for a cool, interdisciplinary project...

**Let me know!**

Outside of the office, I like painting, watching stand-up, and riding motorcycles.
