I am a PhD candidate, who is interested in applying computer science methods to behavioral research.

During my master studies, I decided to integrate my hobby (computer science) with my research (behavioral science).

New methods to acquire, process, and analyze data are always fascinating to me and I have a lot of fun applying them.

Most of my work focuses on developing software or statistical techniques for scientists, but I regularly participate in applied projects advancing psychological theory.

So if you have an idea for a cool, interdisciplinary project...

**Let me know!**

Outside of the office, I like watching stand-up, playing soccer, and walking my parents' 14-year old dog Dobby, who is a Golden Retriever that is balding on the nose and has lost some of his early-life agility, but who, nonetheless, brings joy to anyone who visits my parents, and who is going to live forever.
