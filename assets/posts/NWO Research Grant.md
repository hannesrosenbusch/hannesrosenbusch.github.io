<h1> New research grant </h1>

We received this grant for a research proposal focusing on motivations and mechanisms contributing to radical group behavior (e.g., violence, destruction of property). 

It was centered around the questions how group power predicts radical behavior and which intergroup emotions underlie intergroup attacks.

The PhD project would have been partly realized at the University of Groningen and partly at the University of St Andrews.

I decided to not accept the grant as I was increasingly convinced to focus on computational methods in my career. Still, I keep an eye out to merge ideas from the proposal into my work.
