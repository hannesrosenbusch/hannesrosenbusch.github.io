<h1> Office AI plugin </h1>

In my academic writing, I found myself copy-pasting between Office Word and web-based AI tools a lot.

To make writing/editing more convenient, I built a sidepanel add-in for word where I task an AI to make edits/suggestions right in my document.

I also added a chatbot window as I sometimes need responses that do not land in the text (e.g., general writing tips).

Below I made a 90-second demo of the tool.

You can download the tool from github and use it yourself if you'd like to.
