<h1> New software release </h1>

A lot of computational literary science is occupied with annotating character behaviors in books or movies. Often, the goal is to test statistical hypotheses (e.g., "authors are more likely to mention a character's weight if the character is female").

Unfortunately, researchers have to annotate a LOT of texts to get reliable results (I've done it; it's very tiring). Therefore, I wrote software that partially automates this process by relying on a coordinated collaboration between human experts and AI bots. 

I demonstrated the new software (a python package called LLM_annotate) by scoring personality traits of the Pride and Prejudice characters:
