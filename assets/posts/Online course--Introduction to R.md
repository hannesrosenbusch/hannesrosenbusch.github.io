<h1> New R course </h1>

R is a programming language that allows you to do virtually anything with data from answering research questions to building AI applications. In this interactive course, you can learn how to get started with R (and programming in general), how to analyze data with R, make cool visualizations and memes, build web-applications, and much more. If you're already familiar with R and want to branch out into the sister language Python, there are companion lectures for each of the videos.
