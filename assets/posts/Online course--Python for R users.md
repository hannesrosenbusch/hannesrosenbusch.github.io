<h1> New Python course </h1>

Both R and Python are great programming languages for research and data-sciency activities. Many developers and scientists argue that a multi-lingual approach provides the highest versatility, as one can use tools from both R AND Python. In this lecture series, you will learn how to use Python, and combine it with R for beautiful coding projects. The course assumes some basic programming knowledge (e.g., from my R course) but if you know what data structures, loops, conditions, and functions are, you're good to go :)
