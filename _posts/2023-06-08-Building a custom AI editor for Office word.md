excerpt: "I regularly use Office Word; same goes for AI tools. Time for a user-friendly integration."

I found myself copy-pasting between Office Word and web-based AI tools a lot.

To make writing/editing more convenient, I built a sidepanel add-in for word where I task an AI to make edits/suggestions right in my document.

I also added a chatbot window as I sometimes need responses that do not land in the text (e.g., general writing tips).

Below I made a 90-second demo of the tool.

You can download the tool from github and use it yourself if you'd like to.
