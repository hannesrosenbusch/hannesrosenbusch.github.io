excerpt: "A project in which we disentangle the effect of vlogger emotions and the overarching effects of vlogger personality on audience emotions"
---

We found that multiple mechanism independently contribute to such emotion transfers, suggesting simultaneous contagion and homophily effects (see Figure below).
