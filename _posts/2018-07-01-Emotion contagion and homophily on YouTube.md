excerpt: "A project in which we disentangle the effect of vlogger emotions and the overarching effects of vlogger personality on audience emotions"
---

In this project we analyze over 2,000 YouTube vlogs and use multilevel analyses to distinguish immediate and sustained emotion transfers from vloggers to their audiences.

We found that multiple mechanism independently contribute to such emotion transfers, suggesting simultaneous contagion and homophily effects (see Figure below).
