I have spent the last years working on my debut novel. The expected year of release is 2025. Below is a blurb :)

<br>

"A teenage girl overdoses in her parents' attic.

A lonely baker dies on a university campus. 

Halfway to the afterlife together, they meet a psychology-obsessed angel who promises them reanimation if they can find a renewed sense of purpose.

As their time ticks away, they discover that a life worth living comes at a high price."
