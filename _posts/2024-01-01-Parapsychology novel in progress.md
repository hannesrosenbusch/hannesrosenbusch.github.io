I have spent the last years working on my debut novel. The expected year of release is 2025. Below is a blurb :)

<br>

"A lonely baker is shot on a university campus. 

A teenage girl experiments with drugs in her parents' attic.

Halfway to the afterlife, a childish angel promises them reanimation, but only if they find a renewed sense of purpose.

As time ticks away, their hope rests on a failed parapsychologist designing inspirational challenges for all residents of the Reanimation Zone."
