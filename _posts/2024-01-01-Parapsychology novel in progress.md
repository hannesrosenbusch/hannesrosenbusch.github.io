I have spent the last years working on my debut novel. The expected year of release is 2025. Below is a blurb :)

<br>

"A lonely baker is shot on a university campus. 

A teenage girl experiments with drugs in her parents' attic.

Halfway to the afterlife, this duo encounters a childish angel, who promises them reanimation on the condition that they find a renewed sense of purpose.

As time ticks away, their only hope is a failed parapsychology student who designs inspirational challenges for all near-death-residents of the Reanimation Zone."
