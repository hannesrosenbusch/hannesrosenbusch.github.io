excerpt: "Recording from L'Institut Fran√ßais de la Mode"

I gave a short talk about the predictability of personality from clothes.

The following three questions are addressed through original reseach:

<ul>
  <li>What kind of inferences do people make about each other based on their clothes?</li>
  <li>Are these inferences "random" or are they truly a reliable result of the observed clothes?</li>
  <li>Can computer vision models imitate human personality inferences when we show it images of clothing?</li>
</ul>

The talk was recorded live in Paris in front of an interdisciplinary group of designers, empirical researchers, managers, and students.
