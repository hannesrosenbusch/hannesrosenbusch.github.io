R is a programming language that allows you to do ANYTHING with data from answering research question to building AI applications. In this interactive course, you can learn how to get started with R (and programming in general), how to analyze data with R, make cool visualizations and memes, build web-applications, and much more. If you're already familiar with R and want to branch out into the sister language Python, there are companion lectures for each of the videos.
