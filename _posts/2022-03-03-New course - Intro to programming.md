Michael Nunez and I recently finished the first iteration of our course "Introduction to programming", in which behavioral science students (mostly from psychology) get their hands dirty with R and Python.
It was by far the most work and the most fun I had teaching. You can watch all the lectures and even check out the weekly programming challenges (clone the [course repository](https://github.com/mdnunez/PIPS_course){:target="_blank"}).

After last year's "Deep learning in Python course" it was the first prgramming focussed course I have taught and I really see a lot of opportunities to do these courses especially well and especially poorly. 

Things that helped a lot were 1) having lots of teaching assistants to grade and help students, 2) having MANY practical sessions for students to work on their coding challenges and ask questions, 3) have a nice platform for student-student and student-teacher communication (we had a very good experience with Slack), 4) using assignments to highlight that the newly gained skills can be used to create original things that one can be proud of (games, apps, plots, memes...), and 5) explicitly normalize making mistakes, being lost, googling, and asking questions as essential parts of the coding process (students might not be used to fail so much). 

Especially point 4) and 5) were essential to maintain a highly motivated group of students as we certainly did not go easy on them in terms of desirable difficulties and helping them to help themselves.
I am very much looking forward to teaching this course again next year!
