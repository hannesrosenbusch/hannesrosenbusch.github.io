excerpt: "2 workshops I gave on machine learning. Python for economists; R for psychologists."

Given that many machine learning methods and models are still new to social scientists, I was invited to give a hands-on workshop for Tilburg's economics department. In the first part, I covered traditional differences between supervised machine learning and classic methods in economics (click [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/ml.pptx) for ppt). In the second part, we generated some example code together using sklearn in jupyter notebooks (click [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/code.ipynb) for notebook).

Further, I gave a similar workshop to psychology staff. This workshop concentrated on R, rather than Python, as it is more commonly used in psychology. More precisely, I introduced R's awesome caret package for machine learning (Kuhn, 2015).
