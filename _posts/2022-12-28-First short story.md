<b>Wedding Crashers: Season 1</b>

“You are in the hospital. They said you will pull through, but your teeth are pretty messed up buddy.”
I stared up at Brian through the clearing fog. He shuffled his feet awkwardly.

“The show… Argh!” The words made my spine pierce into my brain. “did… we… win?” I could see the answer on my friend’s pained face.

“Lara really tried, man. She put her weight into the bat and everything just like you told her. But she only smashed out three of your molars. She also cracked your right cheekbone for two points, but the groom of the winning couple lost eight teeth on the first swing. His wife basically took his head off with that thing. He is next door. Not sure if he is going to make it.”

I let my head fall back on the pillow, blinding pain washing over me. Tears started to fill my eyes. This was it. The worst scenario. 

Staring at the ceiling, I carefully cleared my throat. “Lara… where?”

“She is still with that shrink from the show.” Brian squirmed uncomfortably. “She is pretty messed up by all of this.” 

Lara had been ambivalent from the start—<i>why can’t we just have a normal wedding<i/>—but I had bullied her into participating. As usual. For years, people told her I wasn’t good enough. Now she would finally agree.

I could hear Brian nervously tapping his fingernails against the metal frame of the bed. “The doctors kind of keep pestering Lara about the payment for your emergency surgery. You guys being married now and all.”

I stayed silent. What could I say to that.

Brian gently patted the blanket. “Don’t worry buddy. I will make something up.” His eyes wandered through the room. “Do you want some TV? I think you could use the distraction.”

The big clock on the wall showed eight on the dot. He switched on the tiny screen in the corner. The Wedding Crashers theme came blaring through the old speakers. “Oh, sorry bud. Probably the last thing you want to see right now, right? Where is that damn remote?”

I spotted my folded tuxedo on a chair. A few blood stains were visible on the white shirt. The rental place had offered a great price when I had mentioned the show. 

Brian sat down at the end of the bed. “Apparently, the grooms are racing to gnaw off their girls’ ring finger with their teeth.” His eyes were fixed on the screen. “One million less in the pot than yesterday though. They can barely afford a proper honeymoon if they win.”
