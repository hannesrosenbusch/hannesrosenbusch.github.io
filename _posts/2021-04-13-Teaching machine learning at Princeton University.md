excerpt: "I uploaded the practice run for my first guest lecture at Princeton."

Recently, my colleagues and I published a paper serving as a hands-on introduction to machine learning for behavioral scientists. In response, Robin Gomilla invited me to share my knowledge in his course on Advanced Statistics. 

As I usually do, I recorded the practice run for the lecture and given the positive experience in the live sessions, I decided to upload the presentation part here. While the practice run wasn't super smooth yet (and a bit weird given that I was talking exclusively to myself), it should be useful for students trying to get into machine learning.

Later, I also supervised his graduate students on writing their first machine learning scripts. To this end, I used various examples from the classic prediction challenge: Who survived the Titanic disaster? Unfortunately, this hands-on material was quite interactive, and I could therefore not record a practice run.
